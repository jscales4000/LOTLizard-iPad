# LotLizard - iPad Project Log

## Version 0.1.0 - 2025-07-30

### Overview
This update focuses on methodically troubleshooting and fixing the drag-and-drop functionality in the LotLizard iPad project, particularly the integration between the equipment Sidebar and the Konva.js Canvas component. The implementation allows equipment to be properly dragged from the sidebar and placed on the canvas with full touch/mouse support.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Architecture Improvements
- Successfully transitioned from desktop-first HTML5 drag-and-drop to touch-optimized Konva.js native implementation
- Implemented KonvaDragContext to provide global state coordination between sidebar and canvas
- Added CanvasTypeAdapter to reconcile Equipment and EquipmentItem data models
- Created KonvaCanvasConnector as the main integration point between app state and Konva

#### 2. Drag-and-Drop Debugging & Fixes
- Enhanced container detection with multiple reliable identifiers (ID, data attributes, CSS classes)
- Fixed drag preview positioning to follow pointer movements accurately
- Added robust error handling and debug logging throughout the drag-and-drop flow
- Implemented direct coordinate-based drop detection as fallback for unreliable event propagation

#### 3. TypeScript Improvements
- Resolved type compatibility between CanvasEquipment and EquipmentItem
- Fixed state management in KonvaCanvasConnector with useState for dynamic equipment updates
- Added proper type definitions for global canvas instance and equipment registration

#### 4. Bug Fixes
- Addressed React hydration mismatch warnings for SSR/client components
- Resolved "process is not defined" ReferenceError in client-side code
- Fixed premature drag cancellation by implementing proper event coordination
- Enhanced event listener registration for more reliable drop detection

### Next Steps
- Implement multi-touch support (pinch-to-zoom, pan, rotate)
- Add visual feedback (drop target highlighting, shadows, animations)
- Improve performance with memoization and optimized rendering
- Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases

### Technical Notes
- Feature flag enables gradual rollout and A/B testing between implementations
- SSR disabled for Konva components to prevent React hydration issues
- Event listeners properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- Global state synchronized between Konva Stage and React component hierarchy
