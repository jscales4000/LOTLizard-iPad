# LotLizard - iPad Project Log

## Version 0.2.0 - 2025-07-31

### Overview
This update completes the drag-and-drop functionality implementation with polished user experience improvements. The focus was on perfecting the equipment selection workflow and implementing automatic state management for seamless multi-item placement.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Drag-and-Drop System Completion
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Real drag-and-drop functionality now fully working
- Blue drag preview follows cursor/finger smoothly during drag operations
- Accurate coordinate conversion from screen to canvas position
- Canvas boundary detection prevents drops outside valid area
- Proper event cleanup and state management implemented
- Works seamlessly on both desktop (mouse) and touch devices

#### 2. User Experience Enhancements
- **Immediate Equipment Selection**: Items are selected instantly on mousedown/touchstart
- **Smart Drag Detection**: 5-pixel movement threshold prevents accidental drags
- **Click vs Drag Distinction**: Simple clicks select items, dragging moves them to canvas
- **Automatic Selection Reset**: Selection clears after successful equipment placement
- **Continuous Workflow**: Sidebar stays open for rapid multi-item placement

#### 3. Technical Implementation Details
- **RobustDragContext**: Timing-aware drag state management with proper event listeners
- **DragPreview Component**: Visual feedback component that follows cursor position
- **Global Callback System**: Canvas notifies Sidebar when equipment is successfully placed
- **Distance Threshold Logic**: Prevents UI lag and distinguishes clicks from drags
- **Event Coordination**: Proper cleanup prevents stuck drag states

#### 4. Architecture Refinements
- Replaced legacy drag context with simplified, robust implementation
- Implemented safe DOM utilities for className handling and canvas container detection
- Added comprehensive logging and error boundaries for drag/drop lifecycle
- Created unified equipment type system (CanvasEquipmentItem) for type safety
- Fixed hydration mismatch warnings by moving conditional logic appropriately

### User Flow Achievements
✅ **Select item** → Item becomes active (blue border)
✅ **Drag across screen** → Blue preview follows cursor smoothly
✅ **Release over canvas** → Equipment placed at exact location
✅ **Selection auto-resets** → Ready for next item immediately
✅ **Sidebar stays open** → Continuous placement workflow

### Next Steps
- Equipment selection and manipulation on canvas (select, move, rotate, resize)
- Multi-touch support (pinch-to-zoom, pan, two-finger rotate)
- Visual feedback enhancements (drop shadows, hover effects, animations)
- Snap-to-grid functionality for precise equipment placement
- Performance optimizations for large equipment sets

### Technical Notes
- Successfully resolved all timing and DOM readiness issues (Opus's Solution 1)
- Global event listeners ensure smooth drag tracking across entire viewport
- TypeScript errors resolved with proper type declarations and imports
- Server Component compatibility maintained through global callback pattern
- Cross-device compatibility validated for mouse and touch interfaces

## Version 0.1.0 - 2025-07-30

### Overview
This update focuses on methodically troubleshooting and fixing the drag-and-drop functionality in the LotLizard iPad project, particularly the integration between the equipment Sidebar and the Konva.js Canvas component. The implementation allows equipment to be properly dragged from the sidebar and placed on the canvas with full touch/mouse support.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Architecture Improvements
- Successfully transitioned from desktop-first HTML5 drag-and-drop to touch-optimized Konva.js native implementation
- Implemented KonvaDragContext to provide global state coordination between sidebar and canvas
- Added CanvasTypeAdapter to reconcile Equipment and EquipmentItem data models
- Created KonvaCanvasConnector as the main integration point between app state and Konva

#### 2. Drag-and-Drop Debugging & Fixes
- Enhanced container detection with multiple reliable identifiers (ID, data attributes, CSS classes)
- Fixed drag preview positioning to follow pointer movements accurately
- Added robust error handling and debug logging throughout the drag-and-drop flow
- Implemented direct coordinate-based drop detection as fallback for unreliable event propagation

#### 3. TypeScript Improvements
- Resolved type compatibility between CanvasEquipment and EquipmentItem
- Fixed state management in KonvaCanvasConnector with useState for dynamic equipment updates
- Added proper type definitions for global canvas instance and equipment registration

#### 4. Bug Fixes
- Addressed React hydration mismatch warnings for SSR/client components
- Resolved "process is not defined" ReferenceError in client-side code
- Fixed premature drag cancellation by implementing proper event coordination
- Enhanced event listener registration for more reliable drop detection

### Technical Notes
- Feature flag enables gradual rollout and A/B testing between implementations
- SSR disabled for Konva components to prevent React hydration issues
- Event listeners properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- Global state synchronized between Konva Stage and React component hierarchy
